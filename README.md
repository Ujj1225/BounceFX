"ImageFX: Interactive Image Filtering Application"

In the context of the project name, "FX" stands for "Effects." So, "ImageFX" implies an application that deals with image effects or filters. It suggests that the application is focused on applying various effects to images. Here, I have focused on making a user interface which allows end user to do the following things with images:

    Load Images: Users will have a feature to select and load images from your computer.
    Adjust Brightness: They will be able to make the loaded image brighter or darker.
    Convert to Black and White: They can turn the image into a black and white version.
    Highlight Edges: Users can also apply a filter that makes the edges of objects in the image more pronounced.
