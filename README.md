"BounceFX: Interactive BounceBall"

In the context of the project name, "FX" stands for "Effects." So, "BounceFX" implies an application that deals with interactive bouncing ball effects. It suggests that the application is focused on creating an interactive simulation of bouncing balls. Here, I have focused on making a user interface which allows the end user to do the following things with the bouncing balls simulation:

Control Camera View: Users will have the ability to control the camera's view of the bouncing balls.
Toggle Bouncing: They will be able to control the bouncing behavior of the balls.
Explore Physics: Users can interactively observe the physics of ball motion and collision.
Toggle Effects: They can also toggle various visual effects related to ball rendering and environment.
